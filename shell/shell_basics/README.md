# Shell basics

## What is shell?

A shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with an operating system. It provides a way to execute commands, manage files, and automate tasks.

### Common Shell include:
- `Bash`: The Bourne-again shell, widely used on unix-based systems.

- `Zsh`: The Z shell provides more customization options compared to bash.

- `Powershell`: It is primarily used in windows environment.

- `Fish`: It is known for its user-friendliness.

## Working with Shell

### Terminal

A terminal is the user interface for interacting with the shell. It provides a text-based environment for running commands and receiving their output. There're different terminal emulator, examples are gnome-terminal, konsole, xterm, nxterm, eterm, e.t.c.

### Commands

Shell commands are instructions given to the shell to perform specific tasks. They can be simple, like copying a file, or complex, like running a program.

### Command-line arguments

Command-line arguments are values provided to a command when it's executed. They allow you to pass data to the command to control its behavior.

### File path

File paths are used to specify the location of files or directories in the system. Understanding how to navigate and manipulate files using paths is crucial in shell scripting.


### Pipes and redirections 

You can combine commands using pipes ("|") to send the output of one command as input to another.

### Variables 
In shell scripts, you can use variables to store data. They're typically assigned values using `=` sign, like `name="John"`.

### Control structures 

shell scripts support conditional statements and loops for more complex logic.

### Functions

you can define function in shell scripts to modularize code and make it more readable.

### Permissions 

File permissions affect how you can execute and modify files.

### Script execution

To execute a shell script, you need to make it executable using `chmod`, then execute the file.

### shebang

A shebang("#!/bin/bash") at the beginning of a file tells the system which shell to use.

### Quick start

Let's get acquited with some basics commands, how they work, and how to use them before we move to the next section.

**Basic commands**:
- `pwd`: prints the current working directory.
- `ls`: list files and directories.
- `cd`: change directory.

make sure to open up your terminal to test these commands.
